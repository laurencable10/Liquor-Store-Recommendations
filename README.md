## Scenario: Market Research for New Liquor Store Locations
The State of Iowa provides many datasets on their website, including one that contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license.

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that her team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.

For this project, the following fundamental data science skills are practiced:
- Using scikit-learn and stats models to create Linear Regression Models
- How goals and business objectives translate to model fit

## Project Summary
### Problem Statement:
_Predict what potential locations in Iowa will result in the highest sales by investigating the market data from the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset_

### The Dataset
Choose to use either [The full dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5oiz27mhvsiibo8/iowa_liquor_sales_proj_2.csv?dl=0) or 
[this 10% dataset version of Iowa liquor sales](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWaseDB4QU9ZSVFDY2M/view?usp=sharing). You may want to use it anyway to test your code since it will be faster.

### 1. Loading Data & Performing Basic Operations
Checking for null values, converting datatypes, and cleaning data to prepare for EDA.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Investigating varibale distributions, frequencies, and relationships by compiling several visualizations and aggregate functions with the ultimate goal of selecting features to be used in the model building process. 

### 3. Model Building
Utilzing Scikit-Learn and Stats Models to build Linear Regression models, then evaluating performance with their respective metrics. Interpreting the coefficients for all variables will produce the location recommendations for the new storefront, as well as provide additional insight into a strategic business plan.  

### 4. Plotting Results
To further solidify the accuracy of the Linear Regression models built, actual values will be plotted against the predicted values
